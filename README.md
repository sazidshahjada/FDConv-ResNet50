# FDConv-ResNet50
A PyTorch implementation of ResNet50 architecture enhanced with Frequency Domain Convolution (FDConv) for efficient deep learning. This project replaces standard spatial convolutions with frequency domain operations using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve computational efficiency and explore spectral feature learning.
